# Couch Potato

# We created Couch Potato to provide users with an easy way to find meals specific to their dietary needs by searching online.  Going to a grocery store can be tedious with the amount of time searching for items and waiting in long lines.  Couch Potato assists users by searching for recipes and shipping the ingredients to their homes without leaving their couch.  

# The most important piece of information that the user should provide is, other than their email and shipping, information, is the main ingredient for their recipe.   They can then limit it so that it is specific to their diet by requesting a balanced or low carb meal (amongst many other choices).  We will confirm the order(s) and have it delivered to your door.
